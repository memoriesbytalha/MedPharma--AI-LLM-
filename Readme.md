    Within scripts/train_edge_gnn.py please draw the training and testing graphs and try to implement XAI and LLM
    Use these steps:
        Options for GNN explainability:

        GNNExplainer (PyTorch Geometric built-in) → finds important edges and node features that influenced a prediction.
        
        Captum (PyTorch library) → feature attribution (saliency, integrated gradients).
        
        SHAP/DeepSHAP → global/local explanations of features.
        
        👉 For your case:
        
        Highlight which atoms/substructures in SMILES contributed most.
        
        Highlight which drug pair relationships (edges) were critical.
        
        This gives doctors an evidence trail rather than a black-box result.
        
        🧑‍⚕️ 2. LLM for Doctor Interaction (Chat Interface)
        
        Once the GNN predicts "Major/Minor/Moderate/Unknown", you can:
        
        Use a small LLM (like LLaMA 2, Mistral, or OpenAI GPT-4 via API).
        
        Wrap your results in a chat pipeline so doctors can ask:
        
        “Why is Drug A + Drug B a major interaction?”
        
        “What is the risk for a diabetic patient?”
        
        “Suggest alternative drugs with lower interactions.”
        
        👉 Integration:
        
        GNN → predicts interaction.
        
        XAI → generates explanation (important features, subgraphs).
        
        LLM → converts this into doctor-friendly text.
        Example:
        
        “The combination of Drug A and Drug B is predicted to cause a Major Interaction. This is mainly due to overlap in their metabolic pathways (CYP3A4 inhibition),         increasing toxicity risk. Suggested alternatives: Drug C.”
